SiteNode
========

Very small and basic setup for a more versatile but basic interface for webpage
design.

It is an alternative to flatpages, and intended for pages which get extended
on the way.

Downside is, you have to take care cacheing for yourself. Which in many projects
is an upside, if caching behaviour is used differently, than an underlying part,
for that please take flatpages.

Stage
=====

Working alpha.
